SKeylogger is a simple keylogger. I had previously been using a few other open source keyloggers, but they stopped working when I upgraded my operating system. I tried to look through the code of those keyloggers, but it was undocumented, messy, and complex. I decided to make my own highly documented and very simple keylogger.
